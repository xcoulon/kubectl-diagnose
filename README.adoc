You just exposed your application running on OpenShift or Kubernetes to the outter world, but you're getting a `503 Service Unavailable` response when trying to access it? 
Damn'it! ðŸ˜¬

Say hello to `kubectl-diagnose`ðŸ‘‹ 

This tool attempts to find which of the `route`, `service`, `deployment, `replicaset` or `pod` resource is misconfigured or failing, so you don't have to pull your hair out on such a problem.



== Installing

You can either:

- run `go install github.com/xcoulon/kubectl-diagnose` and add `$GOPAH/bin` to `$PATH` or move `$GOPAtH/bin/kubectl-diagnose` in one of the directories of `$PATH`
- clone this repository, run `make install` and add `$GOPAH/bin` to `$PATH` or move `$GOPAtH/bin/kubectl-terminate` in one of the directories of `$PATH`

== Supported Cases

`kubectl-diagnose` is able to detect the following cases:

- when the target Service of an OpenShift Route does not exist (look-up by name)
- when the target Service of an OpenShift Route has no matching port (compare by name or by number)
- when there is no Pod matching the Service selector, look for a ReplicaSet with the same labels and check its status
- when there is no port in the Pod containers matching the Service target port (compare  by name or by number)
- when one of the Pod container is not running (check the status, events and look for error messages in the logs)

== Usage

`kubectl-diagnose` can be run as a standalone command or as a plugin for `kubectl` and `oc` (for OpenShift 4 users) when the binary is in your `$PATH`.

`kubectl-diagnose` uses the same connection settings as the regular `kubectl` and `oc` commands: 

- via the `--kubeconfig` flag if specified 
- via `KUBECONFIG` env var if it exists
- from the default location (`$HOME/.kube/config` on Linux and macOS or `%USERPROFILE%\.kube\config` on Windows). 

== Demo

The https://github.com/xcoulon/kubectl-diagnose/tree/main/examples[examples directory] contains manifests with Routes, Services, Deployments and ConfigMaps for all supported cases, so you can try them by yourself on your OpenShift Cluster.

If you don't have an OpenShift cluster, you can sign into https://https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox] and have a free access to an OpenShift cluster 30 days ðŸ˜‰

Using the `deployment-service-account-not-found.yaml` example:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc apply -f examples/deployment-service-account-not-found.yaml
route.route.openshift.io/sa-notfound created
service/sa-notfound created
deployment.apps/sa-notfound created
configmap/caddy-config-port-8080 configured

$ oc diagnose route/sa-notfound
ðŸ‘€ checking route 'sa-notfound' in namespace 'test'...
ðŸ‘€ checking service 'sa-notfound' in namespace 'test'...
ðŸ‘€ checking ReplicaSet 'sa-notfound-59b5d8468f'...
ðŸ‘» replicaset 'sa-notfound-59b5d8468f' failed to create pods: pods "sa-notfound-59b5d8468f-" is forbidden: error looking up service account test/sa-notfound: serviceaccount "sa-notfound" not found
