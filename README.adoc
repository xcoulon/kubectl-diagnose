You just exposed your application running on OpenShift or Kubernetes to the outter world, but you're getting a `503 Service Unavailable` response when trying to access it? 
Damn'it! ðŸ˜¬

Say hello to `kubectl-diagnose`ðŸ‘‹ 

This tool attempts to find which of the `route`, `ingress`, `service`, `deployment`, `replicaset`, `statefulset`, `persistentvolumeclaim` or `pod` is misconfigured or failing, so you don't have to pull your hair out on such a problem.



== Installing

You can either:

- run `go install github.com/xcoulon/kubectl-diagnose` and add `$GOPAH/bin` to `$PATH` or move `$GOPAtH/bin/kubectl-diagnose` in one of the directories of `$PATH`
- clone this repository, run `make install` and add `$GOPAH/bin` to `$PATH` or move `$GOPAtH/bin/kubectl-terminate` in one of the directories of `$PATH`

== Supported Cases

`kubectl-diagnose` may detect:

- when the target service of an OpenShift route does not exist
- when the target service of an OpenShift route has no matching port
- when there is no pod matching the service selector 
- when there is no port in the pod containers matching the service target port
- when one of the pod container is not running 
- when the statefulset replicas or deployment replicas is set to `0`
- when a persistent volume claim is stuck in `pending` phase

== Usage

`kubectl-diagnose` can be run as a standalone command or as a plugin for `kubectl` and `oc` (for OpenShift 4 users) when the binary is in your `$PATH`.

`kubectl-diagnose` uses the same connection settings as the regular `kubectl` and `oc` commands: 

- via the `--kubeconfig` flag if specified 
- via `KUBECONFIG` env var if it exists
- from the default location (`$HOME/.kube/config` on Linux and macOS or `%USERPROFILE%\.kube\config` on Windows). 

== Demo

The https://github.com/xcoulon/kubectl-diagnose/tree/main/examples[examples directory] contains manifests with Routes, Services, Deployments and ConfigMaps for all supported cases, so you can try them by yourself on your OpenShift Cluster.

If you don't have an OpenShift cluster, you can sign into https://https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox] and have a free access to an OpenShift cluster 30 days ðŸ˜‰

Using the `deployment-service-account-not-found.yaml` example:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc apply -f examples/deployment-service-account-not-found.yaml
route.route.openshift.io/deploy-sa-notfound created
service/deploy-sa-notfound created
deployment.apps/deploy-sa-notfound created

$ oc diagnose route/deploy-sa-notfound
ðŸ‘€ checking route 'deploy-sa-notfound' in namespace 'test'...
ðŸ‘€ checking service 'deploy-sa-notfound' in namespace 'test'...
ðŸ‘€ checking replicaset 'deploy-sa-notfound-59b5d8468f' in namespace 'test'...
ðŸ‘» replicaset 'deploy-sa-notfound-59b5d8468f' failed to create pods: pods "deploy-sa-notfound-59b5d8468f-" is forbidden: error looking up service account test/deploy-sa-notfound: serviceaccount "deploy-sa-notfound" not found
